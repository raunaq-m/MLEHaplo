MULTI-DSK short manual

Installation
------------

* type `make` then `./multi-dsk` for usage.

Compilation options
-------------------

* OSX users should compile using `make osx=1`. (Have not tested for OSX, but should work the same ways)

* To use large values of k, e.g. 150, type `make k=150`.

* To enable multi-threading, type `make omp=1` (omp stands for OpenMP).

* Compilation parameters can be stacked, i.e. `make omp=1 k=100 osx=1`

Input
---------------------
* File input can be fasta, fastq, gzipped or not.

* File containing list of kmers in decreasing order (one per line) required for program to run. For example, to compute k-mer counts for k-values of 15,35,25,45, and 55.. Specify a file "listofkmers" containing :
55
45
35
25
15

i.e. one k-mer per line

* To pass several files as input : create a file with the list of file names (one per line), and pass this file to dsk

Results visualisation
---------------------

* to see the results as a list of "[kmer] [count]\n", type `python parse_results.py [prefix].solid_kmers_binary`
